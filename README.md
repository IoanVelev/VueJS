# VueJS
This repository contains my solutions to various problems and exercises from the SoftUni VueJS 2024 course.

## ABOUT THE COURSE
The training provides knowledge and practical skills to build Single Page Applications (SPA) with VueJS technology - a rapidly growing popular framework used in websites such as Nintendo, Gitlab, Wizzair and Laravel. VueJS provides a very convenient architecture and focuses on declarative rendering and overall component composition.

During the course, special attention will be paid to building and organizing projects, component-based architectures, templating, working with directives and forms, routing and working with REST API information. The program will actively cover both the so-called Options API syntax specific to the library and the new Composition API that was introduced with the latest version. All topics included in the release are applicable to VueJS 2 and VueJS 3 projects.
